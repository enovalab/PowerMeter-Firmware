sentence=Exponentially Weighted Moving Average filter used for smoothing data series readings.
paragraph=Unlike the method with a history buffer that calculates an average of the last N readings, this filter consumes significantly less memory and works faster. Provides an additional EwmaT template that allows restriction to a specific data type, such as uint32_t, to avoiding floating point arithmetics and significantly decrease code footprint.
